# String

In computer programming, a **string** is traditionally **a sequence of [characters](char)**,
either as a **literal constant** or as some kind of variable.
The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed,
or it may be fixed (after creation).
A string is generally considered as a **[data type](data_type)**
and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words)
that stores a sequence of elements, typically *[characters](char)*,
using some **[character encoding](char_encoding)**.
String may also denote more general arrays or other sequence (or list) data types and structures.

## String Datatype

A **string datatype** is a datatype modeled on the idea of a formal string.
Strings are such an important and useful datatype
that they are implemented in nearly every programming language.
In some languages they are available as *primitive types* and in others as *composite types*.
The syntax of most high-level programming languages allows
for a string, usually **quoted** in some way, to represent an instance of a string datatype;
such a meta-string is called a **literal** or **string literal**.
