# Time

## UTC

UTC = **Coordinated Universal Time**, formerly known as **Greenwich Mean Time** (**GMT**).

## Leap Second

a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to *Coordinated Universal Time* (*UTC*),
to accommodate the difference between precise time (as measured by atomic clocks)
and imprecise observed solar time
(known as UT1 and which varies due to irregularities and long-term slowdown in the Earth's rotation).

## epoch

The point where the time starts.
For Unix, the epoch is *January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC)*.

## Unix Time

Also known as **Epoch time**, **POSIX time**, **seconds since the Epoch**, or **UNIX Epoch time**.

The term refers to the total number of elapsed seconds since the epoch,
typically **excluding** *leap seconds*.
Leap seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms.
