# Character

In computer and machine-based telecommunications terminology, a **character** is a unit of
information that roughly corresponds to a grapheme, grapheme-like unit, or symbol, such as in an
alphabet or syllabary in the written form of a natural language.

Examples of characters include *letters*, *numerical digits*, common *punctuation marks* (such as
"." or "-"), and *whitespace*. The concept also includes *control characters*, which do not
correspond to visible symbols but rather to instructions to format or process the text. Examples of
control characters include carriage return or tab, as well as instructions to printers or other
devices that display or otherwise process text.

Characters are typically combined into *[strings](str)*.

Historically, the term *character* was also used to just denote a specific number of contiguous
bits. While a character is most commonly assumed to refer to 8 bits (one byte) today, other
definitions, like 4 bits or 6 bits, have been used in the past as well.
